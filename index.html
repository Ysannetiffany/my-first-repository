            <p>Hello, I am Ysanne Williams. Born and raised in Jamaica, I moved to Canada a little over four years ago to pursue higher education. I delight in being around people I love and making meaningful memories. I am also a dedicated, life-long learner, which is what led me to applying for the DTTP Web development cohort.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="color:red;"> Professional goal</h2>
            <p>My long-term aspiration is to become a Medical Doctor. I aspire to be excellent at whichever field I choose, and not just great at a bunch of little things. <br> I also hope to become extremely skilled at Web Development and learn the ins and outs of coding! I might even create a website for myself to advertise my resume.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="color:red;"> Random fact</h2>
            <p>I <b>LOVE</b> CATS! I've had several cats during my childhood up until I moved to Canada. I am hoping my next landlord will be pet friendly so I can get a cat, or two!</p>
